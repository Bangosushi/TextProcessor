## TextProcessor

A text processor with several features. The processor can remove duplicate lines, find and replace text, read the file, find specific text, sort, and merge multiple files.
All you need to do is place a text file in the root directory of the project.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Java, JUnit


## Optimizations

Refactor methods with overload for write tests that are not dependent of logic/user input.

## Lessons Learned:

It is much harder to write code and then add tests verses starting off with a test (TDD).
